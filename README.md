# CODING CLUB GAMEDEV TASK
## ADVENTURES OF COMPANION CUBE - Made by Akshat Ranjan

I have created a simple runner game where the player is a cube and has to avoid obstacles by moving left and right.
The game was initially created by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL) by Brackeys

Link to the demo gameplay video - https://files.catbox.moe/gbstnx.mp4 (i dont know why the bottom part of the video got cut out)

The game has many references to the game Portal by Valve

I have added some extra features to the game like - 
 1. Sound effects
 2. Textures for the ground , player and obstacles (I didn't make the textures)
 3. A 3D model of a cake for the last level (made in blender)
 4. Two endings to the game

I really enjoyed doing this task. This was my first time using Unity so I learnt a lot as well :)

Please let me know if anything doesn't work because the game was working on my system. I might have messed something up while using git. I am on the gamedev whatsapp group
